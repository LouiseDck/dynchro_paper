# dynchro scales well to large datasets using representative pseudocells

This usecase shows how dynchro can construct and align pseudocells, with little
impact on the alignment results.

## Workflow

1. `1_generate_data.R` generates synthetic data
2. `2_simulated_data.ipynb` analyses the pseudocell generation and alignment of this generated synthetic data
3. `3_palantir_data.ipynb` analyses the pseudocell generation and alignment of real-world biological data.
